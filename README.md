# README: Getting and Cleaning Data
This project uses the code run_analysis.R and the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip to 
format the data for further analysis. It appropriately names the columns and maps the activities with descriptions. Furthermore, it filters the columns to mean and std details only.
